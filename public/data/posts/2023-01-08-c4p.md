Q: **What kind of talk can I submit?**

> The topic for each session is up to you, as long as you're able to fit it into one of the following formats:

> - **Talk**: A speech of variable duration, 10,20, or 40 minutes followed by 5 minutes of Q&A. We differentiate the following categories.

    *   Tech Talk: a session about strictly technical matters.
    *   Soft Talk: a session about non-strictly technical matters
    (we especially enjoy soft skills, inclusion, and diversity, but feel free to submit anything)

> - **Workshop**: usually a hands-on lab in where the speaker teaches a technology, framework, or language to the audience, who will be able to follow along and interactively ask questions to the speaker. We also accept "soft" workshops where the participants can practice and/or improve a skill.
