As it's tradition, after every GDG Pisa event, we like to have a beer together to celebrate and to have a nice chat with all the member of our community and do some **networking**.

DevFest Pisa is no exception! So, how do you feel about joining our **networking beer party** after the conference 🍻?

See you all at [Lo Spaventapasseri - The Scare Crow](https://goo.gl/maps/J5o4SCja6DT2) starting from **7:30 pm** and we will enjoy the rest of the evening together.

Some beers are **offered by the GDG Pisa**, make sure to don't miss it!
