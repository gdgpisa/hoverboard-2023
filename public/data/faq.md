## General

We know that you could have some questions so we prepared for you a list of **FAQs** that may can help you 💪

Anyway we are alway open to solve any other doubt you could have, feel free to [contact us](mailto:pisagdg+devfest@gmail.com) in that case.

### How do I get there?

You can easily reach **Polo Fibonacci** with public transportation or just by walking. Please check the [location page](/location) where you can find further details.

### Do I need a ticket to join DevFest Pisa?

Yes, participation to the DevFest is **free**, but registration is **mandatory**. Being in the waiting list is not sufficient to participate to the conference.

### I can't attend the DevFest, what should I do?

If you **can't attend** we kindly ask you to **cancel your order** via the GDG platform, or either send us an email (we can do it for you). <!--The event is currently Sold-out and we have a lot of people in the waiting list.--> You will free-up a spot for someone else :)

### Do I need to print my tickets?

No, you can use <!--the [Eventbrite app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eventbrite.attendee)-->your smartphone to show us the ticket. Showing the ticket email with the QR code is also enough. Please make sure to have your ticket ready to do not slow down the check-in process.

### Should I come even if I'm still on the waiting list?

You can come even if you're in the waiting list, but we can't assure you will get a spot :( We will release tickets of people that don't show up during day so you may have a chance to get in, but this is out of our control, and we can't tell you in advance if you'll get a place.

### Can I give my ticket to a friend?

Sadly this is not possible. If you're not planning to come, please cancel your ticket and ask your friend to register themselves for a new ticket.

### Can I leave the conference and come back later?

Yes, you can always leave the conference and come back whenever you want. To enter the venue you anyway always need your **badge** (you will get it at the entrance).

### I have the workshop ticket but I don't have the DevFest ticket? Can I participate to the workshop only?

No, as written in the workshop description, you need a DevFest ticket to join all the sessions (either talks or workshop).

### I registered on meetup.com. Is that valid as a ticket?

No, the only valid tickets for eventbrite are the one [available on the GDG platform](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-pisa-presents-gdg-iwd-devfest-pisa-2023/).

### What should I carry on to the conference?

**Your ticket**. That's the only necessary thing you shouldn't forget. If you're attending one of our Workshops, the speakers will let you know if you need to carry on your laptop or not.

### Will I get food/lunch at the DevFest?

Yes, we are offering a **small lunch** (beware just little food and refreshments, not a full lunch) and two coffee breaks. You can find a lot of nice restaurants in [via San Lorenzo](https://goo.gl/maps/Ck5a5kBA1EF2), just a few minutes walk from the venue.

### Are you giving away any gadgets/awards?

Yes, we have some swags for all the participants + some giveaways to give as a raffle 🎁. All the details at the opening ceremony.

### Are the sessions recorded?

No, we are not recording/live-streaming the sessions.

### What is the Job Board? -->

The job board is a pin board where you're free to post your job openings. Rules for the Job board are here: [Introducing the Job Wall](/blog/posts/introducing-the-job-board).

<!-- ### What is the Beer Party? -->
